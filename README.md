# [Project 1: Life Expectancy Indicators: Project Overiew](https://github.com/Code-Calligrapher/my_projects_files/blob/master/World_Happiness_Indicators_Classifier.ipynb)
* Create a classifier to rank which factors are likely to impact life expectancy among classes.
* Load and convert data into a clean format.
* Create model based on both decision tree classifier and logistic regression.
* Compare these two models to select the most effective given their accuracy score.
* Visualize features to spot out which ones have the largest impact to life expectancy.

# [Project 2: Worldwide Covide-19 case in 2020](https://github.com/Code-Calligrapher/my_projects_files/blob/master/worldwide_covid_case_2020.ipynb)
In this project, I have scraped cases about Covid-19 pandamic recorded over the world and rank the most sufferred countries amongst this pandemic last year.

Given the available dataset, I also look up the impact of lockdown policy in reducing the number of cases and fatalities among four countries: India, the UK, Germany and Italy.

# [Project 3: Default Payment Classification](https://github.com/Code-Calligrapher/my_projects_files/blob/master/detect_payments_default.ipynb)
* Find out the most influenced factors that would lead to the higher likelihood of payment default.
* Create multiple models and select the best one.

# [Project 4: Air Quality Management](https://github.com/Code-Calligrapher/my_projects_files/blob/master/air_quality_management.ipynb)
In this project, I analyzed the impact of four pollutants - SO2, NO2, ozone and PM2.5 and compare these levels to precribed annual standards.

Also, given the dateset, identify the pattern of the most pollution intervals over the year which help the authorities can impose adjusted policies to reduce this phenomenon.

# [Project 5: Spam Detection: Project Overiew](https://github.com/Code-Calligrapher/my_projects_files/blob/master/spam_detection.ipynb)
Creating the most efficient model by experimenting four types of classifier:
* Logistic Regression
* Desision Tree
* GaussianNB
* KNeighborsclassifier
Evaluate model performance based on ROC AUC score

# [Project 6: Movies Revenue Measurement: Project Overiew](https://github.com/Code-Calligrapher/my_projects_files/blob/master/movies_revenues_in_France_2018.ipynb)
* Create a tool a rank most profit movies in terms of revenue in France 2018
* Load the dataset request on HTML
* Convert dataset into a clean format
* Identify the most profit movie in 2018, aggregate the monthly average revenue and observe how did it change during the year.

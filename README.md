# [Project 2: Worldwide Covide-19 case in 2020](https://github.com/Code-Calligrapher/my_projects_files/blob/master/worldwide_covid_case_2020.ipynb)
In this project, I have scraped cases about Covid-19 pandamic recorded over the world and rank the most sufferred countries amongst this pandemic last year.

Given the available dataset, I also look up the impact of lockdown policy in reducing the number of cases and fatalities among four countries: India, the UK, Germany and Italy.

# [Project 3: Air Quality Management](https://github.com/Code-Calligrapher/my_projects_files/blob/master/air_quality_management.ipynb)
In this project, I analyzed the impact of four pollutants - SO2, NO2, ozone and PM2.5 and compare these levels to precribed annual standards.

Also, given the dateset, identify the pattern of the most pollution intervals over the year which help the authorities can impose adjusted policies to reduce this phenomenon
